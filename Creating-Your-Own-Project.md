## Creating Your Own Projects

In order to create your own projects from scratch, you will need to create a directory, a Chisel source file, an optional tester, and a build.sbt configuration file.
You should clone the [chisel-template](https://github.com/ucb-bar/chisel-template) repo, which contains a minimal project suitable as a template.
Follow the instructions on that repo's README.
