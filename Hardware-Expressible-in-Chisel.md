This version of Chisel only supports binary logic, and does not
support tri-state signals.

>We focus on binary logic designs as they constitute the vast majority
of designs in practice.  We omit support for tri-state logic in the
current Chisel language as this is in any case poorly supported by
industry flows, and difficult to use reliably outside of controlled
hard macros.
